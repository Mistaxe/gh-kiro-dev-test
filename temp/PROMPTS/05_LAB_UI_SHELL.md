## Step 5 â€“ Lab UI shell (when to prompt)
Prompt after /me/capabilities is available and policy simulator exists.

**Prompt:**
"Create a Next.js (App Router) `/lab` area with tabs: Personas, Scope, Capabilities, Context, Policies, RLS Tester, Seeder, Registry & Availability, Referrals & Notes, Notifications. Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui. Build only the UI shell and navigation first."

**Acceptance checks:**
- Navigable tabs exist; styling is clean; no business logic yet.
